Audit-Ready Logging (All Services)
----------------------------------
Each service must log:
    - Request initiation
    - Masked request/response data
    - Failures and retries (with attempt count)
    - Final outcome
    - Reference number for full traceability

Graceful Error Management
-------------------------
- Standardized error response structure across services
- Detailed error logs (with masked data) for debugging
- Fallback flows for all external integration points
- Retention policy enforcement verified through tests

Business Scenario Coverage (All Services)
-----------------------------------------
Test cases must cover:
    - No Mockito â€” use only standard Spring Boot testing tools and JUnit 5
    - Valid and invalid inputs
    - Successful and failed verifications
    - Edge-case scenarios (e.g., pattern-based triggers)
    - Retry and fallback logic
    - Retention rule applications

Audit & Error Logging Checks
----------------------------
Ensure:
    - All logs use masked sensitive data
    - Unique identifiers trace each transaction
    - Failures log correct predefined error codes
    - Logging validated via tests
