Common Guidelines
-----------------
- Use Java (Maven-based Spring Boot application)
- PostgreSQL as the primary database
- Flyway for schema versioning
- No Lombok (incompatible with Java 21+/24) — explicitly generate all boilerplate code
- No Mockito — use only standard Spring Boot testing tools and JUnit 5
- Follow best practices for:
  - Immutability of key data
  - Validation (field-level, format-specific)
  - Audit-ready logging with masked PII
  - Graceful error handling with standardized messages
  - Data privacy and retention
- Include:
  - Entity classes with explicit accessors and mutators
  - DTOs, Enums
  - Repositories, Services, Controllers
  - Comprehensive testing: Unit, Integration, Regression
  - Unique reference numbers for tracking/logging
